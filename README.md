# Discussion forum in React!

  

I'm building a discussion forum with React as the front end. It's still WIP (hello world to be exact).

Hoping to spend some time on this.

I'm considering GraphQL, MongoDB and Docker for the rest of the application

  

## Requirements

 - NodeJS
 - Yarn
 - Docker
 - Docker Compose

## Run(development with hot reload)

    yarn dev:install
    yarn dev:up
    visit http://localhost on your browser

  

## Run(Production)

    yarn prod:install
    yarn prod:up
    visit http://localhost on your browser
