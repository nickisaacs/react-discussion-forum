# Discussion forum in React!

  

I'm building a discussion forum with React as the front end. It's still WIP (hello world to be exact).

Hoping to spend some time on this.

I'm considering GraphQL, MongoDB, Next.js and Docker for the rest of the application

  

## Requirements

 - NodeJS
 - Yarn
 - Docker
 - Docker Compose

## Run(dev mode only for now)

    yarn dev:install
    yarn dev:up
    visit http://localhost on your browser

  

Will add production mode for docker soon..
